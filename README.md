# waste2worth
For a world where no meal is wasted.
Every day, tons of edible food are wasted in restaurants, households, and food service businesses simply because there’s no efficient system to track and share surplus food. While this perfectly good food goes to waste contributing to resource loss and greenhouse gas emissions, many people in nearby communities still struggle with hunger and food insecurity.
There’s a clear need for a simple, reliable way to connect surplus food sources with NGOs and food banks that can redistribute it to those in need. This project aims to bridge that gap and turn food waste into food support.

//Solution

Waste2Worth is a simple, database-driven system that connects people and businesses with extra food to nearby NGOs and food banks that can share it with those in need. It lets restaurants, cafeterias, and households register and log surplus food items with details like name, quantity, and expiry date. The system keeps an updated list of NGOs and food banks, including their locations and contact details, so food can be matched quickly and easily. Every donation and delivery is tracked to keep things transparent and to provide useful insights — like which items are about to expire, how much food each provider donates, and which NGOs receive the most. By streamlining this process, Waste2Worth helps cut down on food waste, supports sustainability, and makes sure good food reaches people instead of ending up in landfills.
