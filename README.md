# waste2worth
For a world where no meal is wasted.
Every day, tons of edible food are wasted in restaurants, households, and food service businesses simply because there’s no efficient system to track and share surplus food. While this perfectly good food goes to waste contributing to resource loss and greenhouse gas emissions, many people in nearby communities still struggle with hunger and food insecurity.
There’s a clear need for a simple, reliable way to connect surplus food sources with NGOs and food banks that can redistribute it to those in need. This project aims to bridge that gap and turn food waste into food support.
